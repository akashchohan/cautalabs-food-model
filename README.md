# Cautalabs Food Model

A multimodal AI-powered food safety and quality sensing prototype.

This project combines:
- NIR multispectral imaging
- VIS+NIR spectroscopy
- VOC/gas sensing
- Depth (ToF) sensing
- Thermal sensing
- On-device AI inference

Status: Active development (Phase 1 – Core system bring-up)

## Current Status
- Core compute + AI accelerator validated
- Multi-sensor I2C bus stable (BME690, AS7343, MLX90614, OLED)
- Illumination subsystem electrically designed (current-limited, GPIO-isolated)
- Manual trigger interface in progress
