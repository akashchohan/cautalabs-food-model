# MLX90614 – Infrared Thermal Sensor

## Purpose
Measures non-contact surface temperature of food samples, providing thermal context
for spoilage and microbial activity.

---

## Electrical Interface
- Interface: I2C
- Operating voltage: 3.3 V
- Default I2C address: 0x5A

---

## Raspberry Pi Connections

| MLX90614 Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin | GPIO | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|------|------|
| VCC | Pin 1 | 3.3 V | Stable supply required |
| GND | Pin 6 | GND | Common ground |
| SDA | Pin 3 | GPIO2 | Shared I2C |
| SCL | Pin 5 | GPIO3 | Shared I2C |

---

## Operating Notes
- Field of view depends on package variant
- Sensitive to reflections from shiny surfaces
- Best used after purge cycle to stabilize temperature

---

## Known Issues / Debugging
- If not detected:
  - Confirm 3.3V supply
  - Check I2C wiring
- Erratic readings:
  - Avoid airflow during measurement

---

## Validation Status
- I2C detected
- Coexists with BME690


## Debug and Validation Notes

- MLX90614 did not reliably appear in `i2cdetect` during initial integration
- Sensor functionality confirmed using ESP32-C3 via I2C scan and temperature reads
- Raspberry Pi communication verified using direct SMBus reads in Python
- Correct data decoding required masking status bits (0x3FFF)
- Stable ambient and object temperature readings confirmed

This behavior is consistent with known MLX90614 SMBus characteristics and
does not indicate hardware failure.
