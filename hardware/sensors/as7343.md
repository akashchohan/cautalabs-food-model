# AS7343 Spectral Sensor

## Purpose
The AS7343 is a multi-channel spectral sensor used to capture wavelength-resolved reflectance data from food samples. It complements NIR imaging by providing precise spectral intensity values useful for chemical and surface analysis.

## Key Specifications
- Sensor type: Multispectral photodiode array
- Channels: Visible + NIR
- Interface: I2C
- Typical I2C address: `0x39`
- Operating voltage: 3.3 V

## Wiring
| AS7343 Pin | Raspberry Pi 5 |
|-----------|----------------|
| VIN       | 3.3V           |
| GND       | GND            |
| SDA       | SDA (GPIO 2)   |
| SCL       | SCL (GPIO 3)   |
| INT (I)   | Not connected  |
| GPIO (G)  | Not connected  |

INT and GPIO pins are optional and not required for polling-based operation.

## Bring-up Verification
