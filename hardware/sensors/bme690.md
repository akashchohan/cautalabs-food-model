# BME690 – VOC and Environmental Sensor

## Purpose
Provides volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing and environmental context
(temperature, humidity, pressure) for food spoilage detection.

---

## Electrical Interface
- Interface: I2C
- Operating voltage: 3.3 V
- Typical I2C address: 0x76 or 0x77

---

## Raspberry Pi Connections

| BME690 Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin | GPIO | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|------|-------|
| VIN | Pin 1 | 3.3 V | Do not use 5 V |
| GND | Pin 6 | GND | Common ground |
| SDA | Pin 3 | GPIO2 | I2C SDA |
| SCL | Pin 5 | GPIO3 | I2C SCL |

---

## Associated Actuators
- 5 V purge fan
- Controlled via MOSFET on GPIO24

| Function | GPIO | Notes |
|--------|------|------|
| Fan control | GPIO24 | Used for purge/sample cycles |

---

## Operating Notes
- Gas resistance values require heater stabilization
- Sensor should be allowed to warm up before data collection
- Purge cycles improve repeatability

---

## Known Issues / Debugging
- If sensor not detected:
  - Check I2C address via `i2cdetect`
  - Verify 3.3 V supply
- If gas readings unstable:
  - Increase warm-up time
  - Reduce airflow during sampling

---

## Validation Status
- I2C detected
- Environmental readings verified
- VOC response observed
- Fan control verified
