## Phase 2 – BME690 VOC Sensor Integration

- BME690 connected via I2C (address confirmed)
- Temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas resistance validated
- VOC response observed to human breath
- 5V fan integrated via MOSFET on GPIO24
- Fan successfully used for purge cycles

This establishes the environmental and chemical sensing baseline for the system.
