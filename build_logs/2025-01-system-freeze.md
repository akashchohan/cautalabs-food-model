This document marks the point at which the high-level system architecture,
sensor selection, and design philosophy of the Cautalabs Food Model were finalized.

After this point:

- New functionality is added primarily via software
- Sensor fusion and data collection become the primary focus

This freeze is intended to ensure reproducibility and research stability.
